  <h1>HomeValueAI</h1>
  <p>HomeValueAI is a machine learning project that predicts the value of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more. The project uses state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques in machine learning to accurately estimate the value of a home, providing valuable insights to homeowners, real estate professionals, and investors.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To get started with HomeValueAI, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:</p>

  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your_username/HomeValueAI.git
cd HomeValueAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

  <p>Once you have the project and its dependencies installed, you can run the <code>home_value_prediction.py</code> script to predict the value of a home based on its features. The script takes a CSV file as input, where each row represents a property and each column represents a feature of the property.</p>

  <pre><code>python home_value_prediction.py --input_file input.csv --output_file output.csv
</code></pre>

  <p>The output file will contain the predicted value for each property in the input file.</p>
